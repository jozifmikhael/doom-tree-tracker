# Doom Tree Tracker

A RuneLite plugin that tracks the volatile shield path during the Doom of Mokhaiotl boss fight. It marks the tiles between the two volatile earth trees you attack, showing the path the shield will travel from the second tree to the first.

## Features

- Highlights the two volatile earth tiles you attack with configurable colors
- Displays the predicted shield path (diagonal first, then cardinal)
- Removes path tile markers as the shield passes over them
- Fully configurable tile and path colors with alpha transparency support

## Configuration

### Tile Markers
- **First Tile Color** — color of the starting tile of the shield path
- **Second Tile Color** — color of the ending tile of the shield path

### Path Tiles
- **Show Path Tiles** — toggle path tile highlighting on or off
- **Path Tile Color** — color of tiles along the predicted path
